		<h1> Space Animals </h1>
		<h2> Serving in the starts </h2>
		<p> While humans normally receive most of the recognition for travelling into space, animals have also braved the journey and should not be forgotten. 
			Since 1947 when the first animal was launched into space, humans have continued to work with animals for experiments on the effects of microgravity
			on a living being. Whether this process is seen as ethical or not, the animals should be remembered for their service.

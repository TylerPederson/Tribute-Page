			<p class="light-text-blue"> While humans normally receive most of the recognition for travelling into space, animals have also braved the journey and should not be forgotten. 
				Since 1947 when the first animal was launched into space, humans have continued to work with animals for experiments on the effects of microgravity
				on a living being. Whether this process is seen as ethical or not, the animals should be remembered for their service.

				<p class="light-text-yellow"> Albert II became the first monkey successfully sent to space on June 14, 1949. While Albert II survived the flight, he did not survive the fall and 
					died on impact when the shuttle's parachutes failed. Since Albert II, many monkeys of varius species have been sent to space with sensors to test vital signs.
					Unfortunately, many monkeys sent to space in the 1940s and 1950s died due to their missions.

				<p class="light-text-yellow"> As the years passed and experience was gained, space-flight became a safer ordeal. On August 19, 1960, Russia launches Sputnik 5 which carried the two dogs Strelka and Belka
					along with various rodents, flies, and plants. Sputnik 5 became the first spacecraft to bring animals into orbit and return them to the ground safely. Strelka was even able to continue
					her lineage after her missions and some descendants are still alive today. Belka and Strelka have since become icons in Russia, thier likeness appearing on stamps and in movies and their
					bodies on display at the Memorial Museum of Cosmonauts.

				<p class="light-text-yellow"> As recently as April 14, 2015 mice have been sent to space for experimentation. These types of lab mice known as C57BL/6NTAC are the most commonly used mice for scientific experiments. 
					Although they may not have endearing names and used for their expendibility, thier contributions are no different than the other animals sent to space. These mice serve on the ISS to study the effects
					of microgravity living in the hopes that scientists can relate the effects to the human body.
